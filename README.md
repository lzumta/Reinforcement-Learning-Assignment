# Reinforcement-Learning-Assignment
This repository implements different reinforcement learning agents to play a simplified chess game.
It experiments with different parameter and reward settings and tries out Q-learning and Sarsa. 
The optimal agent, winning in more than 99% of the games can be found at the end of the jupyter notebook called "Assignment".
